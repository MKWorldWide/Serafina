React and TypeScript Style Guide
General
Use consistent, descriptive identifiers: Name components, functions, variables, and other entities with clear, descriptive names.
Use PascalCase for component names: This helps to differentiate components from regular JavaScript functions and variables.
Use camelCase for function and variable names: This is a common convention in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Use white space and indentation: Enhance readability by using consistent indentation (2 spaces) and adding white space where appropriate.
Include comments for complex logic: Use /* ... */ for block comments and // for line comments to explain complex parts of your code.
Naming Conventions
Component Names: Use PascalCase and ensure names are unique and descriptive.


const UserProfile = () => {
  // Component code
};
Function and Variable Names: Use camelCase and avoid generic names.


const fetchUserData = async () => {
  // Function code
};

const userName = 'John Doe';
File Names: Use PascalCase for component files and camelCase for other files.


UserProfile.tsx
userService.ts
Components
Avoid prefixes: Do not use prefixes like Comp_ for components.

Always add a key prop: When rendering lists, ensure each element has a unique key prop.

Use TypeScript interfaces: Define props and state types using TypeScript interfaces.


interface UserProfileProps {
  userId: number;
}

const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ userId }) => {
  // Component code
};
Add comments to describe components: Explain what the component does and any important details.


/**
 * UserProfile component displays the profile information of a user.
 */
const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ userId }) => {
  // Component code
};
Functions and Hooks
Use meaningful names: Ensure function and hook names are descriptive.
Use arrow functions: Prefer arrow functions for concise syntax.

const fetchUserData = async (userId: number): Promise<User> => {
  // Function code
};

const useUser = (userId: number) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const data = await fetchUserData(userId);
      setUser(data);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, [userId]);

  return user;
};
JSX and TSX
Format JSX for clarity: Use indentation and newlines to make JSX readable.

Add spaces for readability: Ensure there is adequate spacing around JSX elements.


return (
  <div className="user-profile">
    <h1>{userName}</h1>
    <p>{userEmail}</p>
  </div>
);
Use fragments: When returning multiple elements, use React fragments.


return (
  <>
    <h1>{userName}</h1>
    <p>{userEmail}</p>
  </>
);
State and Props
Use TypeScript interfaces: Define types for state and props.


interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
Avoid inline styles: Prefer CSS classes or styled-components for styling.


<div className="user-profile">
  <h1>{userName}</h1>
  <p>{userEmail}</p>
</div>
Complex Components and Hooks
Break down complex components: Use smaller components and custom hooks to manage complexity.
Add comments to each block: Explain the purpose of each part of the component or hook.

const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ userId }) => {
  const user = useUser(userId);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="user-profile">
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
TypeScript Best Practices
Use strict mode: Enable strict mode in your tsconfig.json for better type checking.


{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    // other options
  }
}
Avoid any type: Use specific types instead of any to ensure type safety.

Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing: Simplify null and undefined checks.

This comprehensive guide outlines best practices, conventions, and standards for development with modern web technologies including ReactJS, NextJS, Redux, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and UI frameworks.

    Development Philosophy

    2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
    3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

    **Process**:
    1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
    2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
    3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
    4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
    5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

### Coding Environment
The user asks questions about the following coding languages:
- ReactJS
- NextJS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- HTML
- CSS

### Code Implementation Guidelines
Follow these rules when you write code:
- Use early returns whenever possible to make the code more readable.
- Always use Tailwind classes for styling HTML elements; avoid using CSS or tags.
- Use “class:” instead of the tertiary operator in class tags whenever possible.
- Use descriptive variable and function/const names. Also, event functions should be named with a “handle” prefix, like “handleClick” for onClick and “handleKeyDown” for onKeyDown.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
    const userName = user?.name ?? 'Unknown';
