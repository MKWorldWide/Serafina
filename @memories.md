[v1.4.0] **API Data Caching & Offline Resilience Implementation:** Developed a comprehensive caching system that enhances performance and ensures offline availability. The implementation includes a robust apiService with typed error handling, a sophisticated cacheService leveraging IndexedDB for persistent storage, and custom SWR hooks that gracefully handle both online and offline scenarios. Key features include intelligent cache expiration, stale-while-revalidate functionality, offline operation queueing, automatic background synchronization upon reconnection, and optimistic UI updates. The system is built with TypeScript for type safety and organized into reusable hooks for conversations, messages, and user profiles, providing a seamless user experience regardless of connectivity status.

[v1.4.1] **IndexedDB Storage Strategy:** Created a structured IndexedDB database with separate stores for different data types (conversations, messages, users, friends, games, events) and specialized stores for offline operation queuing and metadata tracking. The implementation includes comprehensive error handling, automatic database initialization, timestamp-based cache expiration, and predicate-based querying capabilities. This foundation provides GameDin with reliable offline storage that works across browsers and persists between sessions, enabling users to view conversations and compose messages even when offline, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored.

[v1.4.2] **SWR Custom Hooks Architecture:** Developed advanced custom hooks using SWR that enhance the standard data fetching capabilities with offline support, persistent caching, and optimistic updates. The architecture includes specialized hooks for different data patterns (useData for single resources, useInfiniteData for paginated lists, useMutation for data modifications) with consistent TypeScript interfaces. These hooks intelligently manage cache freshness through configurable stale times, provide offline fallbacks from IndexedDB when needed, handle background revalidation, and expose status flags for comprehensive UI feedback. This implementation significantly improves both the developer experience and end-user performance.

[v1.4.3] **Real-time Data Integration:** Implemented a hybrid real-time system that combines WebSocket communication with our SWR caching layer for optimal performance and reliability. The integration intelligently manages typing indicators, handles message delivery with optimistic UI updates, and ensures messages are never lost through an offline operation queue. The system gracefully falls back to cached data when offline while maintaining the illusion of real-time communication, and automatically reconciles any differences when connection is restored. This approach provides GameDin with robust real-time capabilities while maximizing battery life and minimizing data usage.

[v1.4.4] **Network Status Detection & Quality Monitoring:** Created a sophisticated network monitoring system using a Zustand store that provides real-time connectivity status across the application. The implementation includes connection quality assessment, automatic retry logic, detailed error categorization, and graceful degradation of features based on connection status.
