=======
*This scratchpad file serves as a phase-specific task tracker and implementation planner. The Mode System on Line 1 is critical and must never be deleted. It defines two core modes: Implementation Type for new feature development and Bug Fix Type for issue resolution. Each mode requires specific documentation formats, confidence tracking, and completion criteria. Use "plan" trigger for planning phase (üéØ) and "agent" trigger for execution phase (‚ö°) after reaching 95% confidence. Follow strict phase management with clear documentation transfer process.*

`MODE SYSTEM TYPES (DO NOT DELETE!):
1. Implementation Type (New Features):
   - Trigger: User requests new implementation
   - Format: MODE: Implementation, FOCUS: New functionality
   - Requirements: Detailed planning, architecture review, documentation
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí 95% confidence ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

2. Bug Fix Type (Issue Resolution):
   - Trigger: User reports bug/issue
   - Format: MODE: Bug Fix, FOCUS: Issue resolution
   - Requirements: Problem diagnosis, root cause analysis, solution verification
   - Process: Plan mode (üéØ) ‚Üí Chain of thought analysis ‚Üí Agent mode (‚ö°)

Cross-reference with @memories.md and @lessons-learned.md for context and best practices.`
