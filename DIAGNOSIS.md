# Serafina Bot Repository Diagnosis

## Current Status (2025-09-05)

### Environment
- **Node.js**: v24.7.0 (LTS)
- **Package Manager**: npm (with pnpm-lock.yaml detected)
- **TypeScript**: 5.6.3
- **React**: Downgraded to v18.2.0 for testing compatibility
- **Testing**: Vitest setup in progress

### Current Focus
- Setting up testing infrastructure with Vitest
- Resolving dependency conflicts
- Establishing a stable development environment

## Current Issues

### 1. Dependency Management
- ❌ React version conflicts (downgraded to v18.2.0)
- ❌ Testing library compatibility issues
- ❌ Inconsistent package manager usage (mixing npm and pnpm)

### 2. Testing Infrastructure
- ✅ Vitest configuration files created
- ❌ Test utilities need updating for React 18
- ❌ Mocking strategy for Discord.js needs implementation
- ❌ Missing test coverage configuration

### 3. Development Environment
- ✅ TypeScript configuration updated
- ❌ Inconsistent .gitignore coverage
- ❌ Missing .npmrc for consistent package installation
- ❌ No pre-commit hooks for linting/formatting

### 4. Documentation
- ❌ README needs updating with current setup instructions
- ❌ Testing documentation needed
- ❌ Missing CONTRIBUTING.md updates for new contributors

## Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Stabilize Dependencies (IN PROGRESS)
1. Resolve React version conflicts
2. Standardize on npm or pnpm
3. Update all dependencies to compatible versions

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure
1. Complete Vitest setup
2. Implement Discord.js mocking
3. Set up test coverage reporting
4. Create initial test suite

### Phase 3: Development Environment
1. Standardize configuration files
2. Set up pre-commit hooks
3. Improve error handling and logging

### Phase 4: Documentation & CI/CD
1. Update README and CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Set up GitHub Actions for testing
3. Implement proper CI/CD pipeline

## Migration Notes
- React downgraded from v19 to v18.2.0 for testing compatibility
- Testing framework migrated from Jest to Vitest
- TypeScript configuration updated for better module resolution

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Resolve remaining dependency conflicts
2. Complete Vitest configuration
3. Create basic test suite for core functionality
4. Set up test coverage reporting
5. Document the testing approach for contributors
